### Project Summary: Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project

**Objective:**  
The primary goal of the project is to develop two distinct machine learning models that cater to different aspects of text-based data analysis. The first model focuses on sentiment analysis of movie reviews, aiming to predict whether a review is positive or negative. The second model is designed to classify news articles into predefined categories based on their content.

**Part A: IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis**

- **Overview:** This component of the project involves analyzing IMDb movie reviews to determine the sentiment expressed in the texts.
- **Methodology:** Various text preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods (e.g., TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words), and classification algorithms (like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks) will be utilized to build a model capable of accurately classifying sentiments.

**Part B: News Article Classification**

- **Overview:** This part aims to develop a model that can automatically classify news articles into categories such as sports, politics, and technology.
- **Approach:** The project will employ methods like TF-IDF and word embeddings for feature extraction and use classification algorithms to categorize the articles.

**Technological Tools:**
- Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, NLTK, spaCy, TensorFlow/Keras, etc.
- Jupyter Notebook for code development and documentation.
- Visualization tools such as matplotlib and seaborn for data representation.
